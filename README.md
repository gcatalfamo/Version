# Version plugin for Phonegap #

Version allows you to get, display and use the version name and version code of your PhoneGap application.

## Adding the Plugin to your project ##

Using this plugin requires [Android PhoneGap](http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android).

1. To install the plugin, move www/version.js to your project's www folder and include a reference to it in your html file after phonegap.js.

    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="version.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    
2. Create a directory within your project called "src/com/phonegap/plugins/" and move Version.java into it.

3. In your res/xml/plugins.xml file add the following line:

    &lt;plugin name="Version" value="com.phonegap.plugins.Version"/&gt;

    CAUTION: Using PhoneGap â‰¥ 2.0 (aka Cordova) you have to add this line into res/xml/config.xml in the &lt;plugins&lt;-section. The plugins.xml is no longer supported. The plugins are all located in the config.xml

## Using the plugin ##

The plugin creates the object `window.plugins.version`.  To use, call one of the following, available methods:

	window.plugins.version.getVersionCode(
		function(version_code) {
			//do something with version_code
			console.log(version_code);
			
		},
		function(errorMessage) {
			//do something with errorMessage
			console.log(errorMessage);
			
		}
	);

	window.plugins.version.getVersionName(
		function(version_name) {
			//do something with version_name
			console.log(version_name);
			
		},
		function(errorMessage) {
			//do something with errorMessage
			console.log(errorMessage);
			
		}
	);
